<h1>Hello World<h1>
<h2>Difference Between @Autowired and @Bean</h2>	
	
@Bean tells Spring 'here is an instance of this class, please keep hold of it and give it back to me when I ask'.

@Autowired says 'please give me an instance of this class, for example, one that I created with an @Bean annotation earlier'.
